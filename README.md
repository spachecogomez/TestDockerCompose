This is a sample of usage for docker compose, based on the documentation of docker that can be found on https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/.

If you want to run it use the following command

<code>
docker-compose up
</code>

That will run the compose containers, redis and python and run the app.py script.


If you want to use a remote docker host use the following command.

<code>
docker-compose -h HOST_IP up
</code>
